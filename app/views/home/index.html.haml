      Spot-A-Tron is a Twitter clone designed solely for posting "Spotify":http://www.spotify.com URLs and sharing them with your friends, so it's easy to tell your friends what you're listening to.

    Planned features for Spot-A-Tron include Twitter integration, pagination (No-one else could ever list that as a feature) and a sack of bling.

      Spot-A-Tron was made by "Mac":http://www.shrieking.net over Christmas 2008 in a buck's fizz fueled frenzy, and is the first thing to appear on "Very Happy Things":http://www.veryhappythings.co.uk.  It is written in "Ruby on Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org and is forever indebted to the awesomeness of "HAML":http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/, "Kuler":http://kuler.adobe.com and "Nigella":http://www.nigella.com/.
