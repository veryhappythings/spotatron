      Spot-A-Tron was made by "Mac":http://www.shrieking.net over Christmas 2008 in a buck's fizz fueled frenzy, and is the first thing to appear on "Very Happy Things":http://www.veryhappythings.co.uk.  It is written in "Ruby on Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org and is forever indebted to the awesomeness of "HAML":http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/, "Kuler":http://kuler.adobe.com and "Nigella":http://www.nigella.com/.
